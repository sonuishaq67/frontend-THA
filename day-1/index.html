        Respected Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
        I highly recommend Peter Ballis as a candidate for XYZ College. I have served as Peter's supervisor in his capacity as a camp counselor at ABC Summer Camp for the past four years. From serving as a counselor-in-training in eighth grade to being promoted
        to head counselor last year, I have watched Peter develop into a confident and capable leader. Peter is extremely responsible; not only is he accountable for a group of fifteen children every summer, but, as head counselor, he also supervises
        the counselors-in-training and assists them with any issues they may have. On days when I am not on site, Peter is the counselor I know I can rely on to make sure the other counselors' days run smoothly. He is a natural leader who can always be
        counted on. I am extremely impressed by Peter's organizational skills. Not only does he come up with detailed weekly schedules for his campers, but he also makes sure that his group arrives on time to every activity. I know this ability to organize
        and budget time will serve him well in a college setting. Peter is an organized, intelligent, and capable young man who would be an excellent addition to your school. Feel free to contact me with any questions at (555) 555-5555 or Madeleine.Grimes@email.com.
        <p>Your's sincerely,
            <br /> Ishaq Shaik
